A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or descreasing.
Sometimes we store the index of the elements in the stack and make sure the elements 
corresponding to those indexes in the stack forms a mono-sequence.
key point index and value need to store
34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
239. Sliding Window Maximum

[1,3,-1]
stack =[1]
stack=[3]
stack=[3,-1]



another way to solve sliding window we can apply 2 pointer to solve it 


#Sliding window work really well if the current solution has the form 
 S[i]=S[i-1]-s[0]+s[n]
# 2 poitner work for sort: mergeSort and work well for palidrom (2 case only odd even string odd start from middel out 
even start from both side)

#Precomputation is just using like 2 poitner first one start at 1 and the orther one start at last poitner

#####@# Index as a hash key
If you are given a sequence and the interviewer asks for O(1) space, it might be possible to use the array 
itself as a hash table. For example, if the array only has values from 1 to N, where N is the length of the array, 
negate the value at that index (minus one) to indicate presence of that number.








I follow this, Quality matters not the quantity. I used to pissed of, when I started solving questions in leet code. But I used the below strategies.

    1,Before solving the leet problems, I made my mind that I am going to face very bad situation. You should make your mind ready for that what ever the situation is.
    2.Try to solve the Monthly Challenge problems. You will encounter different concepts.
    3.After Solving Every Question, Separate the Questions what ever you solved by your own and not done by you. Make a seperate list of checklist ( Visit / Revisit List )
    4.Every week on Friday Night, I used to revise the questions what ever the questions I have done in this week.
    5.Makes a separate notes. what is the strategy in the question ? Can I do in this way or another way ? Can I reduce the memory or can I reduce the time complexity ?
    6.After Solving Every 50 questions, I used to revise the questions again in less time. At this point of time, if you are not able to solve the question in 20 min, add that question to revisit list.
    7.Repeat 4,5,6 again.
I used to track time using chrome extension. Because leetcode does not provide any time for solving the questions in problems section.

I bookmarked few discuss you can go through them and prepare your own strategy.
