A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or descreasing.
Sometimes we store the index of the elements in the stack and make sure the elements 
corresponding to those indexes in the stack forms a mono-sequence.

#####@# Index as a hash key
If you are given a sequence and the interviewer asks for O(1) space, it might be possible to use the array 
itself as a hash table. For example, if the array only has values from 1 to N, where N is the length of the array, 
negate the value at that index (minus one) to indicate presence of that number.
